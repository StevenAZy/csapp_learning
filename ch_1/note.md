# A tour of computer systems

## 1.1 Information is bits + context

- All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits.

## 1.2 Programs are translated by other programs into different forms

- source program(hello.c) -[Preprocessor]-> Modified source program(hello.i) -[Compiler]-> Assembly program(hello.s) -[Assembler]-> Relocatable object programs(hello.o) -[Linker]-> Executable object program(hello)

## 1.3 It pays to understand how compilation system work

- Optimizing program performance.
- understanding link-time errors.
- Avoiding security holes.

## 1.4 Processor read and interpret instructions stored in memory
